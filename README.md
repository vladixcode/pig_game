# The Pig Game (JavaScript & HTML & CSS)

This is a simple demo game called "The Pig Game" based on random numbers. I created this for learning purposes and fun.

There are some visual effects implemented by adding/removing CSS classes to HTML elements with JavaScript. There is also a good example of implementing init function for initializing state (setting and resetting) of the game. Also we have 2 modals with blur effect: one containing game rules before start, and another one for the winner with nice animation that imitate people dancing at the winning party.

This project is good example of all 3 core frontend technologies blended together creating DOM driven application versus Data driven using modern frameworks like Vue or React.
